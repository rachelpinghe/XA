# Fix Laptop Screen Display Issue

## Problem
The Mario game loads and plays correctly in the Scene view, but only shows a blue background color on the laptop screen in Game view. This is because the laptop screen's mesh scale and UV mapping don't match the 1920x1080 render texture resolution.

## Root Cause
The render texture is created at 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio), but the laptop screen mesh likely has different proportions or UV mapping that doesn't properly display the full texture.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Screen Mesh
1. In the Unity Hierarchy, find your laptop/computer screen object
2. Select it and look at the Inspector
3. Note the current scale values in the Transform component
4. Check if it has a Mesh Renderer component with the correct material assigned

### Step 2: Fix the Aspect Ratio
You have two options:

#### Option A: Adjust the Render Texture Resolution
1. In the DeskGameController script component in Inspector:
   - Change `Texture Width` to match your screen's aspect ratio
   - Change `Texture Height` to match your screen's aspect ratio
   - For example, if your screen mesh is more square: try 1080x1080
   - If it's wider: try 1920x1080 but ensure the screen mesh matches

#### Option B: Adjust the Screen Mesh Scale (Recommended)
1. Select the laptop screen object in the Hierarchy
2. In the Transform component, adjust the scale to match 16:9 aspect ratio:
   - If the current scale is (1, 1, 1), try (1.77, 1, 1) for width
   - Or if it's rotated differently, adjust accordingly
   - The key is making the width 1.77 times the height (16:9 ratio)

### Step 3: Check UV Mapping
1. Select the laptop screen mesh object
2. In the Inspector, check the Mesh Filter component
3. If the mesh has incorrect UV mapping:
   - Create a simple Quad from GameObject > 3D Object > Quad
   - Replace the current mesh with the Quad
   - Scale the Quad to fit your laptop model
   - Apply the laptop screen material to this Quad

### Step 4: Verify Material Settings
1. Find your laptop screen material in the Project window
2. Double-click to open it in the Inspector
3. Ensure the material shader supports the `_MainTex` property
4. If using Standard shader, make sure the Albedo texture slot shows your render texture
5. Check that Tiling is set to (1, 1) and Offset is (0, 0)

### Step 5: Test Different Positions
1. With the Mario game loaded, try moving the game camera in the Scene view
2. Look at the laptop screen in Game view to see if the image appears
3. If you see parts of the Mario game, the issue is camera positioning
4. Adjust the game camera position in the script's SetupGameCamera() method

### Step 6: Alternative Quick Fix
If the above doesn't work:
1. Create a new Quad: GameObject > 3D Object > Quad
2. Position it exactly where your laptop screen should be
3. Apply the laptop screen material to this new Quad
4. Scale it to 1.77:1 ratio (e.g., scale X=1.77, Y=1, Z=1)
5. Disable the original laptop screen mesh
6. Test if Mario now appears on this new screen

## Debugging Tips
- In Game view, you should see the blue background color changing if you move Mario around
- If the background color changes but Mario doesn't appear, it's a layer or camera positioning issue
- If nothing changes at all, it's likely a scale/UV mapping issue
- Use the Scene view to position the game camera to see Mario, then check if it appears on the laptop screen

## Expected Result
After fixing the scale/aspect ratio, you should see the full Mario game (with Mario character, enemies, coins, etc.) displaying correctly on the laptop screen in Game view, matching what you see when playing in the Scene view.
